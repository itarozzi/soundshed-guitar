// Where an element was last drawn, so it can be redrawn by that rectangle (UiSession::Repaint)
// rather than by Elements' view::refresh(element). That one queues the element and, at the next
// poll, searches the tree for it; past four queued in one poll it gives up and redraws the
// whole window. While audio plays the meters, chain lights, readouts and knobs change together
// on every telemetry tick, so the whole window was redrawn 20 times a second: cheap enough on a
// GPU backend, but on iOS, where Quartz draws on the CPU, it held the main thread and touches
// waited behind it. A widget that changes with the feeds inherits this and calls NoteDrawn in
// its draw().
