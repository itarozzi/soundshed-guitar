// ResourceFolderScanner — listing a folder of NAM captures and IRs for the
// resource browser, without ever blocking the message thread.
//
// Enumerating a folder can stall for seconds on a network share or a sleeping
// drive, and parsing each .nam/.wav for metadata is slower still, so none of it
// runs on the message thread. The request handler does only two cheap things —
// snapshot the library's (filePath, id) index and spawn a worker — and returns.
//
// A generation counter supersedes in-flight scans: every request bumps it, and
// a worker that observes a newer generation drops its results and returns. That
// is what keeps a user clicking quickly through folders from racing three
// listings onto the screen in the wrong order.
//
// Workers are detached rather than joined, because joining would reintroduce
// the message-thread stall the design exists to avoid. Teardown therefore has
// to wait for them explicitly: Shutdown() supersedes every outstanding scan and
// blocks until the last one has left, so no worker can outlive the callback it
// publishes through. It is idempotent, and the destructor calls it.
//
// The scan reports in two phases, so the listing appears before the expensive
// part starts: "resourceFolderListing" carries the entries with
// metadataPending set, then "resourceFolderMetadata" streams the parsed
// metadata back in batches. Failures at any point become
// "resourceFolderListingFailed".
