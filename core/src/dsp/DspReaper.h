/// (which try_locks and outputs silence on failure), so retired preset instances and
/// global-chain executors are moved onto a queue and destroyed on a background thread
/// instead. Moving is cheap and allocation-free as long as the queue has spare capacity,
/// which lets the audio thread retire finished fade-outs itself via a try_lock.
///
/// A chain holding a hosted plugin or anything else that must be torn down on the message
/// thread (SignalGraphExecutor::AnyNodeRequiresMainThreadLoad) goes to a second queue, which
/// only CollectMainThread() empties.

/// Neither copyable nor movable: its thread is bound to this address, and a mixer that is
/// moved keeps its own reaper.
