/**
 * Real-time monophonic note detection for guitar: where notes start and stop, how hard they were
 * picked, and where their pitch goes in between.
 *
 * PitchTracker (dsp/PitchTracker.h) says what pitch is sounding, continuously. That is what a
 * pitch-following oscillator, a tuner or a tracking ring modulator wants. A MIDI note stream wants
 * something else: "a note began here, this hard, at this pitch; it moved there; it stopped here".
 * This turns the one into the other, with two level followers beside the tracker:
 *
 * - Attacks. A pick throws broadband energy that the ringing string then loses within tens of
 *   milliseconds, so the power above 4 kHz, followed over 1.5 ms, jumps 6 dB over the same power
 *   followed over 50 ms. That finds a re-pick of a note that is still ringing, which the overall
 *   level barely shows; lower, the harmonics of a high note that is still ringing hide it. An
 *   attack re-arms once the two have come back together.
 * - Starts. After an attack the note is placed at the first detection whose estimate the tracker
 *   has accepted as its pitch. If a note was already sounding and that reads the same pitch, it
 *   is only believed once the tracker's window has mostly moved past the attack: until then it may
 *   be reading the old note. A pitch held above the threshold for three detections with no attack
 *   seen (a volume swell) starts a note too.
 * - Moves. A move of over a semitone from the note's pitch (a hammer-on, pull-off or slide) is
 *   reported as a legato note, anything smaller (a bend, vibrato) as a glide; either only once two
 *   detections in a row agree, since one whose window straddles the move reads between the two.
 *   A move of an octave has to hold for three: a power chord or a strong second harmonic can flip
 *   the tracker between a note and its octave, and a legato octave is rare in playing.
 * - Stops. The note ends when it is muted (the level falls 20 dB under the note's own, which a
 *   ringing string never does that fast; not in the note's first 50 ms), when the level stays
 *   6 dB under the threshold for longer than the longest period tracked, or when nothing pitched
 *   has been found for 100 ms.
 *
 * The threshold cannot usefully go below about -52 dBFS: the pitch tracker holds its last pitch
 * rather than read anything under -55 dBFS RMS.
 *
 * Velocity is the attack's peak, placed between the threshold (0) and -6 dBFS (1).
 *
 * The events come out through a callback, at the sample they were decided on, so a caller can
 * place them within its block. Prepare() allocates; nothing else does, and nothing locks.
