/**
 * Real-time convolver with no latency: non-uniform (Gardner-style) partitioning.
 *
 * The first 256 or 512 IR samples run as a direct-form FIR, and the rest as
 * uniformly partitioned overlap-save (UPOLS) FFT stages whose partitions grow with
 * their offset into the IR, so the output has no latency at all. An IR no longer
 * than the FIR runs on the FIR alone. All buffers are allocated by SetImpulse(),
 * none on the audio thread. See RealtimeConvolver.cpp.
 *
 * Each FFT stage spreads a block's partition multiplies across the samples of
 * that block rather than doing them all at the block boundary, so per-callback
 * cost stays flat even when the host block is much smaller than the partition.
 *
 * Until 2026-10 a Low Latency switch could run the whole IR as one uniform engine
 * instead, 256 to 2048 samples late. It saved little CPU on short IRs and cost more
 * on long ones (docs/plans/zero-latency-ir-cab.md), so it is gone.
