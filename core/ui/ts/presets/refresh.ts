/**
 * Indirection for "the preset library changed, redraw it".
 *
 * The renderers live in library.ts, because they need the dropdown, the
 * library list and the active-preset UI. Archive import finishes by asking for
 * that redraw, and so do load, save, the popover and the folder and setlist
 * controls after they change something — but library.ts imports several of
 * those to bind its rows, so importing it back would tie them into a cycle.
 *
 * So the seam states the relationship as it is: those modules *request* a
 * redraw, they do not own the rendering. library.ts and actions.ts register the
 * implementations once, at module load. Same pattern as signalPath/render.ts.
